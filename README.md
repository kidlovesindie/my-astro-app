# Hello, World!

This is my test site for using Astro and Cloudflare Pages to create a blog. 

I wanted to learn the following things:

- ✅ How quickly and easily I could create and deploy a blog using Astro and Cloudflare Pages. Answer: It was super easy, especially after I had my GitHub repo set up.
- ✅ See Astro's guided help installation process on the CLI. Note: It was awesome!
- ✅ Have an excuse to tinker and get hands-on experience with building my own website outside of Notion. 

If you want to see how easy it is, I recommend using [Cloudflare's tutorial](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-an-astro-site/) if you want to create a basic app or launch your own Starlight doc site. If you're interested in a blog, you can check out Astro's blog tutorial below.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |

| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
